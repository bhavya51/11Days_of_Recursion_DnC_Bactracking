# 11Days_of_Recursion_DnC_Bactracking

## Overview

This repository documents my journey through the 11DaysOfCoding Challenge. I took this challenge on the 28th of November as part of the #DrGViswanathan initiative by VIT Bhopal University, this initiative allows us to share our small as well as greater milestones uniquely. During this challenge, I committed to solving at least one coding problem each day for 11 days on Platforms like Geeks for Geeks and LeetCode, fostering a consistent coding routine.

## Structure:

* Each day's solution is organized in separate files, each file named after the problem.
* The code is written in Java.
* Clear and concise comments accompany the code for better understanding.

## Why 11DaysOfCoding?

Participating in the 11DaysOfCoding Challenge allowed me to maintain small yet effective coding streaks, establishing a consistent routine. This practice not only enhanced my problem-solving skills but also prepared me for technical interviews during placement initiatives. During these 11 days, I mainly focused on Recursion, Backtracking as well as Divide and Conquer.
